# P0 Isolated Verifier Ledger

**Goal:** compile immutable Published Compilations into isolated generated
applications, prove their runtime behavior, and produce safe reviewable
diagnosis-to-Draft-Diff evidence.

**Design:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-isolated-verifier-goal-design.md`

**Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-06-isolated-verifier.md`

**Owner:** PM role; only the PM advances task state.

## Status vocabulary

```text
planned -> implementing -> ready_for_qa -> reviewed -> accepted
```

Any P0/P1/P2 finding, unexplained digest change, contract expansion, secret
leak, or cleanup failure returns the task to `implementing` with evidence.

## Baseline

- Prior compiler plugin Goal accepted at `1137e1e` on the inspected branch.
- Existing fresh gates: `@factory/compiler` 329/329; compiler-worker 81/81;
  compiler and worker typechecks pass; compiler lint passes.
- Existing preview lifecycle is in `apps/compiler-worker/src/preview-runner.ts`.

## Task ledger

| Task | Deliverable                                        | State   | Target commit | Evidence |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------- | -------- |
| 1    | Verification/evidence/Draft-Diff contracts         | planned | —             | —        |
| 2    | Isolated lifecycle and cleanup                     | planned | —             | —        |
| 3    | Migration, API, role, denial, idempotency probes   | planned | —             | —        |
| 4    | Deterministic diagnosis and constrained Draft Diff | planned | —             | —        |
| 5    | Control Plane persistence and review APIs          | planned | —             | —        |
| 6    | BullMQ integration and one profile acceptance      | planned | —             | —        |
| 7    | Independent gates and release hand-off             | planned | —             | —        |

## Gate protocol

Each task must record: changed paths, tests run and exact counts, typecheck,
lint/build status, redaction/security observations, residual risks, and commit
hash. The task reviewer, QA, release reviewer, and PM must independently cite
the same commit before a task advances.

## Completion marker

`GOAL_COMPLETE` is forbidden until Task 6 demonstrates the full loop and Task 7
records fresh independent review, QA, release review, PM acceptance, a clean
worktree, and a remote-reachable commit. The next Goal after completion is
staged AI composition (`RequirementSpec -> CompositionPlan -> constrained
Graph Diff`).
